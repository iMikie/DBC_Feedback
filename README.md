# DBC_Feedback
My feedback on the DBC Ruby-Rails Program

Great ideas were started, like our blogs, but never finished.  Why?  I know it's a Holocracy, maybe that's the problem.  A symphony written by committee.  When the ideas of one instructor are dropped by the next it doesn't feel like everyone respects each other enough to reach a coherent plan.  

It also feels like there was a good start at a plan that's been drifting for a while.  

Many non-technical things are thrown at us.  Pick two and carry forward.  Letting us choose from many is OK too but follow through, come back to them later. Have volunteers present 

More on pair programming.   In phase 0, some of us have programmed before, others haven't.  Those who have end up driving and all to often leave their navigators in the dust.  I suggest a solution on my blog. 

##Phase 0.
I thought Phase 0 was the most organized and coherent of the phases.  **What worked well** for me was what was being specific:
* Read this...
* Watch that video...
* Do these challenges
And you'll be fine.

As a student launching into the unknown, the implied contract gives you a place to stand and a way of knowing if you get it. Embrace the confusion along the way, but know where you are heading.

What could have worked:  We spent a lot of time on our blog, and on our technical and non-technical challenges.  Then this was abandoned in the latter phases.  The stated idea was to have a chronical of our learning, I still think that is a good idea.

What worked even better was how well things were motivated.
