# DBC_Feedback
My feedback on the DBC Ruby-Rails Program

Great ideas were started, like our blogs, but never finished.  Why?  I know it's a Holocracy, maybe that's the problem.  A symphony written by committee.  When the ideas of one instructor are dropped by the next it doesn't feel like everyone respects each other enough to reach a coherent plan.  

It also feels like there was a good start at a plan that's been drifting for a while.  

Many non-technical things are thrown at us.  Pick two and carry forward.  Letting us choose from many is OK too but follow through, come back to them later. Have volunteers present 

More on pair programming.   In phase 0, some of us have programmed before, others haven't.  Those who have end up driving and all to often leave their navigators in the dust.  I suggest a solution on my blog. 

##Phase 0.
I thought Phase 0 was the most organized and coherent of the phases.  **What worked well** for me was what was being specific:
* Read this...
* Watch that video...
* Do these challenges
And you'll be fine.

As a student launching into the unknown, the implied contract gives you a place to stand and a way of knowing if you get it. Embrace the confusion along the way, but know where you are heading.

What could have worked:  We spent a lot of time on our blog, and on our technical and non-technical challenges.  Then this was abandoned in the latter phases.  The stated idea was to have a chronical of our learning, I still think that is a good idea.

What worked even better was how well things were motivated.  

Javascript game, Sudoku, group challenges and presenting solutions: these worked.
Lightening challenges: half worked, half failed.  There needs to be accountability.  If someone simply fails, then we all fail.  The instructor needs to come to the rescue.  There needs to be a penalty.  Without it, fewer and fewer cared. At the end these were throwaway.

Tools:
Mastery: you need to know what is important to learn, reflect, then quick reference multiple times.  DBC is great on the first two.  I created a set of quick refs for the third for the cohort after us and received huge positive feedback.  
  * I started with markdown.  No reason to waste an hour hunting down and figuring out how to do this.
  * Then I did a Ruby quick ref: There is a time before you can really follow Ruby Docs, and Ruby Docs can be slow. Many times all you need is "OK, how does that each_with whatever look like again."  
  * I did a git quickRef.  The first video was good.  No one remembered it.  I helped so many (and myself) that I came up with this.  I probably got more "Halleluiahs" on this than anything.
  * SQL quick tutorial and bridge to ActiveRecord
  * Active Record: no need, just use Hunter's lecture slides and online.  I may yet do an advanced AR QuickRef but 
  
Reflecting was killer.  Force it through the entire 3 phases.  Make it a separate blog that must be updated every day.  If you have mastered I think you need to hit something 10 times before you learn it.   DBC does well on the learn.  I think 

  * Clear git quickref:  the video was great, other
